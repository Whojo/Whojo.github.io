            <p>John, our main hero, was cradled by myths throughout his childhood
                which has resulted in attracting him to video games. Indeed, he is
                now a critique in this industry. But today is not a day like any other,
                he is invited by the powerful company Zelstrom to test a
                all-new revolutionary game. <br></br></p>
            <p>Thus, John went to an incredible building which is Zelstrom's headquarters. 
                He meets the bosses who explain to him the project.
                The project is based on the player's memories to create an unique experience.
                John is equiped with a massive helmet connected to several wires.
                But he discovers a commonplace game containing vague memories of his childhood.
                John is rather disappointed, he clearly expected better. At the end of the tests, he
                leaves the premises and goes home. While listening to television, he begins
                to write his article. Shortly after starting, a surprising special flash
                appears. A mysterious asteroid just crashed a few kilometers away
                from home. Dreaming, he remembers the legends his father used to tell him
                on asteroids, one of his favorite subjects. He recall a myth about a
                mythical asteroid containing an immeasurable power in its heart and
                which one day was supposed to crash on Earth: Zephyr. Maybe it's this one.
                Curious, he decided to go there. The places are deserted, only the huge
                asteroid faces him. He decides to get closer. But as we descend into the
                crater, it slides and enters inside this huge stone. A powerful
                voice then pronounces these words: <br></br></p>
            <p>- I am Zephyr the legendary asteroid, to obtain the divine power that
                I hold, you'll have to go through a series of hardships and be brave.
                No one has ever done it, but I see an extraordinary determination in yourself.<br></br></p>
            <p>John thus embarks on this quest. He crosses a gigantic dungeon,
                defeating all the monsters in its path until it reaches the final boss. When
                this one is defeated, he discovers the ultimate treasure. When he gets closer to take it,
                an ever brighter light dazzles him. It's the light of victory! He
                then sees the faces of Zelstrom's bosses saying to him:<br></br></p>
