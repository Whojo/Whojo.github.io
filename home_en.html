            <p>Zephyr is an action-RPG based on exploration to bring the player a new gaming experience. This one is
                inspired by the roguelites in the way of rendering the death necessary to be better prepared against the enemies,
                notably by allowing access to purchases facilitating the game, in exchange for resources collected in the course.
                The Roguelites are mainly inspired by a game: <u>Rogue</u>. It has been released in 1980, developed by Michael Toy, Glenn Wichman and Ken Arnold. <br></br></p>
            
            <p>It has inspired many games of recent decades, such as:</p>
            <dl>
                <li><u>The Binding of Isaac</u> : Rebirth, developed par Nicalis
                    <p>A game well known to have distinguished itself from a wave of roguelite published in recent years thanks to
                        a dark atmosphere, despite minimalistic graphics, but especially a large number of objects interacting
                        with the character, as well as a multitude of enemies. Published in 2014, this game has become a staple
                        of the genre thanks to its innovative gameplay, where the acquisition of random equipment is the heart
                        of the game mechanics, and its rather murky world, where we control a child who escapes his mother wanting
                        to kill him. The difficulty is high, therefore the player must always remain alert against the enemies.<br></br></p>
                </li>
                <li><u>Enter the Gungeon</u>, developed by Dodge Roll
                    <p>This is the game fwhich mainly inspired the development team. It has been released in
                        2016 and was quickly known thanks to its dynamic gameplay, its offbeat side and its humor. This game
                        is also really difficult, we are facing rains of balls and some boss can remind us what we see in some
                        shoot'em up. Hence the great utility of a simple gameplay mechanics, but very well exploited, the roll,
                        this is what will allow the players to extricate themselves from the most critical situations.
                        In this game also, equipment will reinforce the character's abilities, or affect the way he attacks, as he is
                        using weapons to defeat his enemies.<br></br></p>
                </li>
                <li><u>Rogue Legacy</u>, developed by Cellar Door Games
                    <p>It is in 2013 that this game is published and it relies on various elements to ensure that each death allows the character
                        to becomes more powerful than before. Indeed, we go exploring a dungeon with enemies, and we stack
                        resources that can be reinvested in equipment once the player has lost. This game is distinguished
                        by a rather advanced personalization aspect compared to most rogue-lite, the player can choose a
                        class each time he replays, and also chooses equipment before entering the dungeon. Known
                        for having a high difficulty, it also manage to impose itself.<br></br></p>
                </li>
            </dl>
            <p><br></br>All the games that have just been listed can also be considered as action-RPGs, these games
                are very nervous, have a high difficulty, and are based on the collection of various objects affecting
                the statistics of the character, thus getting closer to the customization specific to role plays. It's hard to
                say which was the first action-RPG, but some people agree that Nintendo's <u>Legend of Zelda</u> was one of the most
                prominent of the precursors of the genre.<br></br></p>
            
            <p>This kind of game is distinguished mainly by its dynamic and nervous gameplay, requiring a high 
                concentration of the player, especially in certain phases of particularly complex courses. The
                benefits of this kind og  games that will be found in Zephyr will be numerous.<br></br></p>
            
            <p>The increasing difficulty in the levels, and which should be particularly well dosed is one of these
                qualities. Any good game must have a well controlled difficulty throughout the adventure, but this is
                especially true when it comes to action games. This kind of game is mainly based on the fight of enemies,
                if they are too easy to beat, the pleasure of play will be lower, and vice versa, if the
                difficulty is too high, the game becomes frustrating. Thus, the wish of the development team is to
                develop a game far from being easy, but which is not frustrating, the player's mistakes will be punished, without
                leading him to death when doing the slightest error.<br></br></p>
            
            <p>The reactivity of the player is very important too. The game has to be quick by putting the player's
                reflexes to the test, so it's important to have commands that run fast. Thus, it will not be the animations
                that will be privileged during the pressing of a key, but the speed of execution of the entered command, that
                still in order to keep a dynamic game.<br></br></p>
            
            <p>It is also interesting to notice the presence of equipment for the character. This will complete
                the experience of the user giving him more freedom in the way he leads the clashes against different enemies.
                This equipment will give more flexibility in the way of playing, and will have a gameplay that evolves
                according to the preferences of the player.</p>
