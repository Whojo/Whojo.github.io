            <p>After deciding on the overall guidelines for the game. A majestic name was required. Zéphyr stood out from the crowd quite quickly as a game name. But the whole group did not agree on its spelling ("Zéphyr" or "Zephyr"). Following a coin throw (wrongly dropped...), Zéphyr was born.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Then came the time to choose the name of the group. It was after long periods of intense reflection and multiple proposals that Maelström finally emerged. It was able to please the group with its original sound. However, we wanted this name to be closer to Zephyr. Thus the "Ma" of "Maelström" was transformed into "Ze" finally giving Zelstrom./p>

Most of the ideas and mechanics of our game were tuned and tuned up the previous week. After a weekend of intense writing. The specifications were completed on time and returned.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>A major problem appeared: the choice of the logo.... For the sake of simplicity, the "Z" of "Zephyr" has stood out from the crowd. After a laborious installation of photoShop (legally, as you can rightly assume), the manipulation of the software proved to be complicated... The logo therefore took much longer than expected to be produced. But at the end of the evening, this one was over and suited us.</p>

            <p>This week marks the real beginning of the project. So we started planning everything. The tasks in our project have been divided into less complex subtasks and deadlines have been assigned to each of them. This seems to us to be an essential element in order to progress effectively and regularly.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>Once that was done, we moved on to the concrete. The most basic scripts (character and camera movements) were created easily and quickly. The domain name of the site was purchased and the first html push file on the server.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>The excitement of the final result makes us motivated and efficient.</p>

            <p>We just realized that the first defense was already in 3 weeks... The multi has started to be developed. Maybe it was a mistake to start it so late. The main page of the website is finished. The interface (mini map and life display) is under development. There is currently a rather funny bug with the mini map. Indeed, it moves with the movements of the player and the mouse. This is not very practical xD. Moving enemies to follow the player has been successfully implemented. </p>

            <p>This week has been quite challenging. A lot of elements to implement were missing. So we had to work at a fairly steady pace, and entered into what is commonly called "rush", (or simply "I did it too late"). Like any self-respecting rush, the stress was real, but it must be admitted that the project has progressed a lot during this week. Enemies can take damage from the character (enemies, which by the way did not exist before this week), the menus are correctly implemented, we now has the possibility to play together, but above all, we finally have our first bugs!!!!! And that's beautiful:)</p>
            <br></br>
            <p>The defense, it went well overall, we came back to the different points we wanted to put forward. The main problem came from our presentation, but overall the result was quite acceptable!</p>
