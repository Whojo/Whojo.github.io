            <h1 class="title has-text-centered">Player's actions</h1>
            <p>With Zephyr, you will be propelled into a rogue-lite world. Your skills will be tested in many levels.
                You'll have to kill all the enemies on your path. In this purpose, your weapon (and your talent), will be of a great help to you.
                Be careful not to be hit by your enemies. You could die from it and then you'll have to restart again
                (no wow...). But don't worry, you have a dash. This skill allows you to dodge all your enemies' bullets for a short time.
                Finally, you also have a (impressive) special skill that gives you a significant advantage over your enemies. But we will come back to it :)<br></br></p>
            
            
            <p><br></br><u><strong>Movement<br></br></strong></u>
                You enjoy a magnificent aerial view. On the one hand, to contemplate the beauty of your
                character but also to have a strategic vision on the actions of your enemies.
                Choose your movements wisely because they will determine your destiny!!!!<br></br></p>
            
            <u>Commands:</u>
            <p>-"Z" : move forkward</p>
            <p>-"Q": move left</p>
            <p>-"S" : move backward</p>
            <p>-"D": move right</p>
            
            
            
            <p><br></br><u><strong>Shot<br></br></strong></u>
                In addition to moving you can.... SHOOT (yes, we know, we tried to be pretty innovative about this).
                Therefore, aim well.... That's all. <br></br></p>
            
            <u>Command: </u>
            <p>"[LEFT CLICK]"</p>
            
            
            
            <p><br></br><u><strong>Dash<br></br></strong></u>
                Good players (like you:D) don't take damages. But you're lucky, we (nice developers, yes we are) have decided
                to provide you with a skill to help you in this task. This skill is the dash! Thanks to it you'll be able to jump over
                all enemy fire. Enjoy it (but sparingly) :D<br></br></p>
            
            <u>Command: </u>
            <p>"[SPACE]"</p>
            
            
            
            <p><br></br><u><strong>Special capacity<br></br></strong></u>
            
            <p>A character's special skill is a very strong skill. This way you will be able to,
            for example<br></br></p>
            
            <p>Full Care: Bring your character back to full life</p>
            <p>Invincible: Make your character invincible for 2s</p>
            <p>Shockwave: Launch a devastating shock wave around your character</p>
            <p>The Wall: Create a wall in front of you for which you can shelter there<br></br></p>
            
            <p>But obviously it takes time to load. Through the enemies killed, past levels and experience
                gained, your special skill will increase in efficiency< <br></br></p>
            
            <u>Command:</u>
            <p>"A"</p>

            <h1 class="title has-text-centered">Character's choice</h1>
            
            <p>At the beginning of your fabulous adventure, you will have a choice of several characters. Choose carefully this character because it will guide your whole adventure.
                Indeed, each of them has a skill and an initial weapon of his own. To prevent you from abusing (yes we know you a little anyway ...), we put a cooldown between each use.
                See this as a child safety.<br></br></p>
            
            <p>If you don't like this weapon. No problem! You will find others trow out levels (either in the stores or in some chests).
                In addition, your weapon improves with each level, as does your special skill.<br></br></p>

            <p>Your basic weapon is the AK. If you don't like it, know that you are still difficult because it is one of the best
                weapons in the world ... But do not worry we have more than one trick up in our sleeve. But do not think that we will give
                them you like that either ... You find a way out, you will find them during the levels, especially in the stores or in some chests.<br></br></p>
            
            <p>Through your adventures you will be able to find:</p>
